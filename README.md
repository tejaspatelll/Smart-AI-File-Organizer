## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Organization Failed" Error
- **Check API Key**: Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **Verify Permissions**: Make sure you have read/write access to the folder
- **Check Internet**: AI features require an internet connection
- **Try Smaller Folder**: Very large folders (10k+ files) may timeout

#### Application Won't Start
- **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in activated venv
- **Node Version**: Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed
- **Clear Cache**: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again

#### No Files Being Organized
- **Hidden Files**: The app skips system and hidden files by default
- **File Types**: Some file types may not be supported for AI analysis
- **Empty Folders**: Folders with only system files will show as empty
- **Already Organized**: Well-organized folders may not need changes

#### Performance Issues
- **Large Files**: Files >100MB are skipped by default for performance
- **Network Speed**: AI processing requires stable internet connection
- **System Resources**: Close other applications if running slowly
- **Batch Size**: Reduce batch size for slower systems
- **GUI Glitches/Tile Memory Exceeded**: This can occur due to complex visual effects in the UI. Ensure `will-change` CSS property is applied to animated or transformed elements to optimize rendering. Restarting the application after applying changes is recommended.

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: Look in the developer console for error details
2. **Try safe mode**: Use Quick & Smart mode without custom prompts
3. **Test with small folder**: Verify functionality with a small test folder
4. **Check system requirements**: Ensure all prerequisites are met

### Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:
- Operating system and version
- Python and Node.js versions
- Error messages (full text)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Example folder structure (if relevant)
