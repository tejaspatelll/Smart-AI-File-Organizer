    # AI analysis
    category: str | None = None
    confidence: float = 0.0
    reasoning: str = ""
    tags: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    
    # Content analysis
    content_summary: str | None = None
    content_embedding: np.ndarray | None = None
    detected_language: str | None = None
    sentiment_score: float | None = None
    
    # Relationships
    similar_files: List[Path] = field(default_factory=list)
    duplicate_of: Path | None = None
    project_group: str | None = None
```

### 5. Intelligent Duplicate Detection
```python
async def _detect_advanced_duplicates(self, files):
    """Enhanced duplicate detection with content analysis."""
    # Content-based hashing for text files
    # Intelligent original selection
    # Near-duplicate detection
    # Smart conflict resolution
